## How the converter works

The converter uses a simple algorithm to convert binary numbers to decimal numbers. The algorithm works by multiplying each digit of the binary number by the appropriate power of 2 and then adding the results. For example, to convert the binary number "1010" to decimal, we would multiply the first digit, "1", by 2^0, the second digit, "0", by 2^1, and the third digit, "1", by 2^2. This gives us 1 * 2^0 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^2 = 10.
